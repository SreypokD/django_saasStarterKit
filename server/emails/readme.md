This directory contains Transactional Email Templates

Email html is not the same as frontend html, which is why
all the styles are inline and html table elements are heavily used.

The emails are minimally styled to allow users to bring their own unique styles.
It is highly recommended to style the emails before going live. However the
emails are fully functional, meaning that the crucial pieces of info and functionality are
operational and setup. Only styling is required.

The emails are all transactional emails and should not be moved or deleted as this may affect the functionality
of the app.
